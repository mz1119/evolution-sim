# Neural Network / Genetic Algorithm Library Project

This was a practice project and way for me to get familiar with Rust while practicing upon some machine learning principles. 

Essentially, it was an implementation of a FFNN (Feedforward Neural Network) from scratch using basic structs and vecs, and while not the most efficient, allowed for me to practice dealing with these data types in Rust.

Along with the FFNN came a very basic unsupervised learning model in the form of a genetic algorithm that implemented uniform crossover, gaussian mutation, and fitness proportionate selection.

This project was heavily inspired and helped by github.com/patryk27 (https://pwy.io/), as his tutorial of Shorelark was massively helpful towards this project.
